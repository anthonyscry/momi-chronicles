Facing down in 3/4 perspective.\n\nFrame 1: A warm look enters his wise eyes — genuine contentment.\nFrame 2: His mismatched ears both perk up simultaneously — rare for him.\nFrame 3: A gentle tail wag begins, measured and dignified.\nFrame 4: His mouth opens in a distinguished smile, grey muzzle crinkling.\nFrame 5: An unexpected little hop — surprising himself with the burst of energy.\nFrame 6: He catches himself mid-hop, composure briefly lost, eyes bright.\nFrame 7: A happy head shake, ears flapping, whole body wiggling.\nFrame 8: Returns to his wise, contented expression. A single satisfied nod.\n\nThe charm is in the contrast — he's too old and dignified for this but happiness sneaks through anyway. Frame 5-6 is the comedic peak where his inner puppy briefly escapes."
