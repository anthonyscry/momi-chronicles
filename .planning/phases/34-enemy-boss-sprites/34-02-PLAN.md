<objective>
Replace all mini-boss and boss Polygon2D placeholders with AnimatedSprite2D using generated pixel art. Handle boss-specific visuals: Raccoon King's crown, enrage phase, and death particle explosion.

Purpose: Boss fights are climactic moments. The Raccoon King and mini-bosses need to look impressive as sprites, not colored squares with code-drawn crowns.
Output: All 3 mini-bosses and the final boss display as pixel art characters with state-specific visuals.

  NOTE: Mini-boss file names may differ from what's listed (e.g., may not have `mini_boss_` prefix). Check actual filenames first:
  ```bash
  ls characters/enemies/*alpha* characters/enemies/*matriarch* characters/enemies/*rat_king*
  ```

  **For each mini-boss .tscn:**
  1. Remove `Polygon2D` node named `Sprite2D`
  2. Add `AnimatedSprite2D` named `Sprite2D`
  3. Create SpriteFrames:

  **Alpha Raccoon:**
  - `idle` — `art/generated/bosses/alpha_raccoon.png`
  - `slam` — `art/generated/bosses/alpha_raccoon_slam.png`

  **Crow Matriarch:**
  - `idle` — `art/generated/bosses/crow_matriarch.png`
  - `dive` — `art/generated/bosses/crow_matriarch_dive.png`

  **Rat King:**
  - `idle` — `art/generated/bosses/rat_king.png`
  - `poison` — `art/generated/bosses/rat_king_poison.png`

  **For each mini-boss .gd script:**
  1. Change sprite type annotation to AnimatedSprite2D (if declared locally; may inherit from enemy_base.gd which was already fixed in 34-01)
  2. Add `sprite.play("idle")` in `_ready()` or setup
  3. Wire attack states to animations:
     - Alpha Raccoon: ground slam state → `sprite.play("slam")`, back to idle after
     - Crow Matriarch: dive bomb state → `sprite.play("dive")`, back to idle after
     - Rat King: poison cloud state → `sprite.play("poison")`, back to idle after; 50% HP split — keep existing mechanic, just with sprite visuals
  4. Replace `sprite.color` with `sprite.modulate` everywhere
  5. Replace `sprite.scale.x = -1` with `sprite.flip_h = true`

  **Mini-boss scaling:** Mini-bosses are likely bigger than regular enemies (scaled up in code). Check if they use `sprite.scale = Vector2(X, X)`. With sprites, the art is already the right size — remove artificial scaling or adjust to match intended visual size.

  **Health bar:** Mini-boss health bar is positioned above the enemy. Verify it still positions correctly with AnimatedSprite2D (should be fine — it's positioned relative to the enemy node, not the sprite child).
  </action>
  <verify>
  - All 3 mini-boss .tscn files have AnimatedSprite2D, zero Polygon2D
  - Each has correct SpriteFrames (2 animations each)
  - Mini-boss health bar positioning still works
  </verify>
  <done>All 3 mini-bosses use AnimatedSprite2D with idle + attack animations, visual feedback uses modulate</done>

  <name>Task 2: Replace Raccoon King boss Polygon2D and handle special visuals</name>

  The Raccoon King has the most complex placeholder visuals:
  - A Polygon2D scaled to 2.5x
  - A child Polygon2D gold crown
  - Enrage modulate tint at 50% HP
  - Death explosion with 20 ColorRect particles

  **In boss_raccoon_king.tscn:**
  1. Remove `Polygon2D` "Sprite2D" (the 14x14 square)
  2. Add `AnimatedSprite2D` named `Sprite2D`
  3. Create SpriteFrames:
     - `normal` — `art/generated/bosses/raccoon_king_normal.png`
     - `enrage` — `art/generated/bosses/raccoon_king_enrage.png`
     - `death` — `art/generated/bosses/raccoon_king_death.png`
  4. Set `centered = true`

  **In boss_raccoon_king.gd:**
  1. Change sprite type to AnimatedSprite2D
  2. **Remove `_setup_boss_appearance()`** entirely — no more code-built color + crown. The sprite art already includes the crown design.
  3. Remove the `sprite.scale = Vector2(2.5, 2.5)` line — the generated sprite should already be appropriately sized. If the sprite is 32x32 and the boss should be visually larger, apply a scale like `Vector2(2.0, 2.0)` to make it ~64x64, but check that collision shapes match.
  4. Replace enrage visual (currently `sprite.modulate = Color(1.3, 0.8, 0.8)`):
     ```gdscript
     # Instead of just a tint, switch to enrage sprite:
     sprite.play("enrage")
     ```
  5. In `_ready()`: `sprite.play("normal")`
  6. **Death sequence:** The boss death spawns 20 ColorRect particles. Replace with sprite-based death:
     - Change `sprite.play("death")` before the explosion
     - For the 20 death particles: keep the ColorRect explosion particles for now (these are ephemeral VFX, not character visuals). OR if `art/generated/bosses/raccoon_king_death.png` exists as a death frame, use it for the boss sprite but keep the particle explosion as ColorRect (they fade in <1s — barely visible).
  7. Replace all `sprite.color` with `sprite.modulate`
  8. Replace `sprite.scale.x = -1` with `sprite.flip_h = true`

  **Collision:** Boss has larger collision shapes (CapsuleShape2D r=12, h=28). These should still work — they're relative to the boss node position, not sprite size. But verify they match the visual.

  **Boss health bar:** Positioned at top of screen via CanvasLayer — not affected by sprite change.

  **Summon state:** Boss summons minion raccoons. These are separate scenes — already handled by 34-01 (regular raccoon sprite). No change needed here.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Boss scene has AnimatedSprite2D with 3 animations (normal, enrage, death)
  - No Polygon2D nodes in boss scene
  - No `_setup_boss_appearance()` function (or it's been removed/gutted)
  - Enrage switches to enrage animation at 50% HP
  - Boss is visually larger than regular enemies
  - Boss health bar still displays at top of screen
  </verify>
  <done>Raccoon King uses AnimatedSprite2D with normal/enrage/death sprites, crown is part of art (no code-drawn crown), enrage phase uses distinct sprite, death sequence preserved</done>

1. Fight all 3 mini-bosses — each displays as a sprite with attack animations
2. Fight Raccoon King — displays as large sprite
3. Get boss to 50% HP — enrage sprite is visually different from normal
4. Kill the boss — death sequence plays with explosion
5. Boss/mini-boss health bars display correctly
6. `grep -r "Polygon2D" characters/enemies/*boss* characters/enemies/*mini*` returns zero matches

<success_criteria>
- All 3 mini-bosses display as sprites with idle + attack animations

- Boss health bar and combat mechanics unchanged
- No code-drawn crown, no scaled Polygon2D
- Zero Polygon2D references in boss/mini-boss files
